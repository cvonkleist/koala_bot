They're just a waste of time koalas are stupid they don't help me with shit so why should I help them.
Koalas are weak a pit will get rid of their whole fucking family.
That's why I don't like koalas.
Koalas have sharp claws but they are weak.
Koalas aren't hard they some little bitches.
Kangaroo's have some big ass legs and whot do a koala got? Some little ass legs, they tails is little and weak as fuck kangaroo's got a big ass long tail that can kill a fucking koala.
If a koala goes in the water it won't be able to breathe with its little short ass.
The important think about koalas is that just don't care about tem and let them die by all the other animals in Australia.
Koalas do not have a place in this world there's not enough room for all the bitches in this world.
So let all the koalas that's in the zoos and shit.
Now you know why koalas aren't important.
Koalas don't do nothing to help anybody.
Now you know why koalas are not important because there are dumb.
